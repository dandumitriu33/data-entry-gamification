Educational project - practicing SDLC steps and documents  

This is an educational project aimed at practicing Software Development Life  
Cycle steps and documents inside those steps.  

The Documentation folder will contain the road map and the files with the steps  
for all the phases in SDLC.  

The strategy of developing this product is to have multiple iterations.  

Each iteration will build on the previous version based on evidence and  
user feedback.  

There is also another point from the software world: bring value to the  
users/beneficiaries as soon as possible and build on that.

The first iteration is a simple MVP that we can give users so that they can  
start inputing data as soon as possible even though it may contain errors or  
present difficulties.  

Based on the feedback and measured results of this initial version, we will  
add functionality or improvements and use metrics and feedback to confirm  
the value increase.
