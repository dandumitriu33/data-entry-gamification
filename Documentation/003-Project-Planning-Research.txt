Agile Inception Deck)

I. Problem Statement

The world is going through a process of Digitalization. In a lot of cases this 
means transferring data from paper to digital storage solutions in order to 
make it available for Data Science and other tools.

This is a problem because it is not a simple thing to do especially when your 
organization is for example a government institution with years of data in 
large volumes. It is simply too expensive to hire employees for this task. 

Hiring in cheaper regions has risks as the cultural/language differences might 
influence the reliability of the transferred data.


II. Business Case 

One solution is to hire employees for this purpose, train them, give them 
equipment and support and additional resources depending on the project.

Another solution, which we are using in this project, is to organize the 
process of transferring the data similar to a game, with appropriate rewards, 
and make it available to the current employees. 

    1. Reduced costs

This strategy will minimize the efforts and costs of having to hire a new 
department and the related costs to that strategy as current employees already 
have training, resources and the equipment.

    2. Improved motivation

Gamifying boring tasks results in improved motivation to complete this type of 
work because of the additional rewards.

    3. Quick Training

The solution will contain interactive training similar to a game or a tutorial 
one might find on the Internet with images and from the beginner level.

    4. Easy scaling

If additional resources are required for the data input volume to increase, 
they can be assigned from other departments or hired more quickly into the 
already existing mechanism.
