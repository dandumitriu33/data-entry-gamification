I. Problem Statement

The world is going through a process of Digitalization. In a lot of cases this 
means transferring data from paper to digital storage solutions in order to 
make it available for Data Science and other tools.

This is a problem because it is not a simple thing to do especially when your 
organization is for example a government institution with years of data in 
large volumes. It is simply too expensive to hire employees for this task. 

Hiring in cheaper regions has risks as the cultural/language differences might 
influence the reliability of the transferred data.


II. Business Case 

One solution is to hire employees for this purpose, train them, give them 
equipment and support and additional resources depending on the project.

Another solution, which we are using in this project, is to organize the 
process of transferring the data similar to a game, with appropriate rewards, 
and make it available to the current employees. This strategy will minimize the 
efforts and costs of having to hire a new department and the related costs to 
that strategy as current employees already have training, resources and the 
equipment.

In this project we will build a solution that will organize the data transfer 
in small individual tasks, that will be easy to resolve by users in small 
chunks of time, will have a small reward for each task and will contain other 
small mechanisms that will help increase motivation for completing these tasks. 
As a quick example, displaying a score based on how many tasks were completed 
next to the userâ€™s profile picture like a badge, creating AllTime and Periodic 
Leaderboards and so on.
