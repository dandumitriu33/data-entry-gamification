Refactor Backend API routes and flows Clean Code | Priority 1 | Estimate 1 days
As a backend engineer
I want to refactor the backend API routes and flows
So that I can have Clean Code and Clean Architecture in all situations 
consistently.  

Acceptance criteria: all flows to the backend are consistent with regards to 
the API route, the flow main-controller-service and other Clean Code and Clean 
Architecture principles.

Refactor Dates conversion to String for DB | Priority 1 | Estimate 1 days
As a backend engineer
I want to refactor the backend entities and methods to convert dates to string
So that I can send simpler or more intuitive JSON from the frontend.  

Acceptance criteria: the DTO DAO mapping will no longer use the Object for dates
and will use strings. The conversion to date must be done as close to the DB as 
possible to make the other comms simpler/more intuitive.
